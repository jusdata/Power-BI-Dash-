# Dash-By-Jus
Welcome to my **Power BI Dash**! Here I share the interactive dashboards I created covering multiple topics, where I showcased my skills in **data cleaning and data transformation, data modelling, creating new measures and data storytelling through visuals**.

## 🔹Power BI Dashboards

1. *Manufacturing Efficiency Dashboard*  
   - Key Insights:
      1. Leverage more on operators' skills through training and support program.
      2. Machine handling could be the focus of improvement.
      3. Line efficiency and downtime minutes improve when we halve machine-related errors.

2. *DPWH Infrastrcuture Projects - Investigative Dashboard*
   - Key Insights:
      1. About 83 percent of infrastructure projects from 2018 to 2025 are complete, but we can still keep an eye on incomplete and not yet started projects which cost nearly PHP 180 billion.
      2. Legacy Construction Corp. and Sunwest Inc. are notable contractors which bagged a total of 9 billion and 10 billion worth of infrastrcuture projects, respectively.
      3. Quirante Construction Corp. has ten incomplete projects which is worth around 900 million.
      4. Central Luzon is the region with the most tallied infrastructure projects while Bulacan has the most projects in terms province category.
      5. Manila has the most number of incomplete infrastructure projects, worth nearly 2 billion pesos.

3. *GOT GOAT? LeBron vs Jordan Debate - Comparative Dashboard*
   - Key Insights:
      1. MJ averaged a dominant 30 PPG in his regular season career, winning 10 scoring titles for consecutive years. Lebron, meanwhile is also a professional bucket-getter, averaging 25 PPG for 10+ consecutive years while also putting up 7 APG and 7 RPG in his career.
      2. MJ recorded 3,400 total stocks (steal + blocks), notably earning the Defensive Player of the Year award in 1988. LeBron led the league in assist category in Year 19, exhibiting his all-around playing style.
      3. MJ won five Most Valuable Player awards in his 15-year career, while LeBron managed to win 4 MVPs.
      4. MJ is undefeated in the NBA Finals, holding a 6-0 record and winning 6 Finals MVPs, while LeBron currently has been to the Finals 10 times (with 8 consecutive trips ) but only winning 4 chips and 4 Finals MVPs.
      5. Overall, the case for Jordan being the GOAT is his peak. In just a 15-year career, he dominated the league by winning 6 championships, with two 3-peats, which rarely happens in the NBA, bagging 10 scoring titles which is the most in NBA history and also had a Defensive Player of the Year award under his belt as a guard.
      6. LeBron's longevity, however, is undeniable. Still currently playing by the way, LeBron's statistical and record-breaking dominance is well-documented. He is the only player to average 25 PPG for more than 10 years, the only player in league history to have 40K points, 10K assists and 10K rebounds, has the most All-NBA Selection and All-Star Selection and the only player in playoff history to make the NBA Finals 8 consecutive times, just to name a few.

4. *Flood Control Projects Watch - Investigative Dashboard*
   -  _Note: 2025 data is partial and does not represent the full year._

_Key Insights_
       
• Flood Control Projects dominate the budget

FCPs took the lion share of DPWH’s budget, commanding 95% or ₱ 705B. These projects surged in 2022–2024, averaging around 3,000 projects per year. There’s also a notable improvement in the average turnaround time, which now averages 244 days (8–10 months) from 2018–2025. However, this should be interpreted with caution due to the large number of projects with missing actual completion dates.

One thing to possibly explore is to differentiate the average turnaround time for small and big-ticket projects as these two data could further reveal inefficiencies of greater magnitude.

• 2022 was a turning point

The year 2022 marks a key shift as the government realigned priorities post-pandemic, further emphasizing infrastructure as a driver for economic recovery. Discussions on climate resilience and sustainability also intensified, which likely explains the sharp rise in flood control investments.

• Completion Rates and Data Gaps
Unadjusted completion numbers show 9,459 completed projects, but this may be inaccurate because of insufficient completion date data. Thus, incomplete projects could be higher than the reported 263. Worth mentioning also those 1,990 not-yet-started projects amounting to ₱ 162B have missing contractor data. A transparency concern we should keep an eye on.

_Contractor Insights_

• Sunwest Inc (₱ 8.25B), Legacy Construction Corp (₱ 8.03B), and St. Timothy (₱ 4.6B) are major players in total project cost.
Sunwest stands out with 30 high-value projects (≥ ₱ 100M) — far ahead of other contractors — suggesting strong government trust in handling large-scale FCPs.

• To further put this into context, around 45% of Sunwest’s FCP portfolio consists of high-value projects. Based on the dataset, 64 out of 67 are marked as completed, but again, missing completion dates mean these numbers should be treated cautiously and might need further research.

• A critical finding: 60% of high-value projects have no specified contractors. This is a major red flag, given that these projects receive the biggest budgets and should have the highest accountability.

_Regional Analysis_

• Region III (₱ 127B), Region V (₱ 64B), and NCR (₱ 63B) lead in total FCP cost.
Region II (Cagayan Valley), a flood-prone area due to geography, also receives significant funding, but the devastation from super typhoon Uwan raises questions about the effectiveness and existence of some listed FCPs.

Turnaround time varies widely:
• 9 of 17 regions exceed the national average of 244 days.

• Regions with the longest delays are those receiving smaller budgets or handling fewer projects.

• Region III performs the fastest at 206 days average turnaround.

• For high-value projects worth 100M or greater, Region III leads, followed by Region II and Region V. Yet, 163 out of 207 or 78% of these high-value projects in Region III have no contractor specified. In terms of all FCPs, Region III has 288 total missing contractors, followed by Region I (260) and Region II (245).
