      2. MJ recorded 3,400 total stocks (steal + blocks), notably earning the Defensive Player of the Year award in 1988. LeBron led the league in assist category in Year 19, exhibiting his all-around playing style.

In just a 15-year career, he dominated the league by winning 6 championships, with two 3-peats, which rarely happens in the NBA, bagging 10 scoring titles which is the most in NBA history and also had a Defensive Player of the Year award under his belt as a guard.
